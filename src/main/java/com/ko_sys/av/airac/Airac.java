/**
 * An AIRAC cycle.
 * <p>
 * Provides calculations on Aeronautical Information Regulation And Control (AIRAC) cycle identifiers and effective
 * calendar dates.
 * <p>
 * This class is immutable and thread-safe.
 * <p>
 * Regular, planned Aeronautical Information Publications (AIP) as defined by the International Civil Aviation
 * Organization (ICAO) are published and become effective at fixed dates. This class implements the AIRAC cycle
 * definition as published in the ICAO Aeronautical Information Services Manual (DOC 8126; AN/872; 6th Edition; 2003).
 * Test cases validate officially documented dates from 1998 until 2020, including the rare case of a 14th cycle in the
 * year 2020.
 * <p>
 * This class assumes that AIRAC cycles are effective from the effective date at 00:00:00 UTC until 27 days later at
 * 23:59:59 UTC. However that is not correct:
 * <p>
 * ICAO DOC 8126, 6th Edition (2003), paragraph 2.6.4:
 * <p>
 * "In addition to the use of a predetermined schedule of effective AIRAC dates, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)
 * must also be used to indicate the time when the AIRAC information will become effective. Since Annex 15,
 * paragraph 3.2.3 specifies that the Gregorian calendar and UTC must be used as the temporal reference system for
 * international civil aviation, in addition to AIRAC dates, 00:01 UTC must be used to indicate the time when the
 * AIRAC-based information will become effective."
 * <p>
 * However this is a "wontfix", because that may just confuse users.
 * <p>
 * This implementation will silently produce bogus data before the internal epoch of 1901-01-10. Contrary to the
 * original Golang implementation this class does not appear to have a significant upper time boundary. At least
 * values corresponding to dates between 1901-01-10 up to year 2200 are plausible.
 * <p>
 * This class only provides calculations on effective dates, not publication or reception dates etc. Although effective
 * dates are clearly defined and are consistent at least between 1998 until 2020, the derivative dates changed
 * historically.[citation needed]
 *
 * @since 1.8
